[Mochi](https://mochi.cards/) is a study app that uses modifiable flash-cards and a spaced repetition system to maximize study retention and efficiency.  
Sound familiar? There are already many other apps like it. I personally have previously used Memrise and Anki.

In this article, we'll check out this great app and how to use it. I'll also discuss some reasons why I dropped Memrise/Anki in favor of Mochi for my Japanese study arsenal.

## What it is

[Mochi](https://mochi.cards/) is a fully customizable, Markdown-based SRS flash card system.  
Each flash-card is written in _Markdown_ (an easy-to-read text-editing format popular with developers ‚Äì [read more here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)).  
Mochi allows you to build _'decks'_, which are a collection of _'cards'_ (flash-cards) or nested _decks_.  
Mochi automatically builds an SRS-based reviewing schedule from all the cards you've created.

        review them. Cards marked as 'Forgotten' show up more frequently in
        subsequent reviews, and cards marked 'Remembered' show up less.

## Where it shines

You still might be wondering how this differs from other SRS apps such as Memrise or Anki. So here is where it truly out-shines the competition:

### The Markdown syntax

As I mentioned above, by default, each card in Mochi consists of text in the _Markdown_ syntax. Vanilla _Markdown_ gives you enough flexibility alone, that allows lots of ways to freely customize your cards. Add bold text, images, headings, block-quotes, line breaks, hyperlinks, lists, and more to your cards.

Mochi goes one step further with this, and extends the default _Markdown_ syntax system with some awesome and invaluable features _specific to language and Japanese learning_.

These features allow the ability to add the following to your cards:

-   Hidden text that can be revealed with a click (called a _'cloze'_)
    -   A great way to add hints to your cards
-   _Furigana_ on top of _Kanji_
-   References to other cards
-   Text-to-speech conversion _(paid feature)_
    -   Hear the text being pronounced aloud while you go through your reviews üôå
-   Automatic text translation

        „ÄåË®Ä„ÅÑËÅû„Åã„Åõ„Çã„Äç Each row of the text has slightly different wrapping
        syntax, which determines how it will appear visually.

There is definitely a bit of learning required to fully utilize the Mochi _Markdown_-based system and all of its features.  
Until you get into the groove of using it, there is some documentation on using the _Markdown_ syntax and how to create cards. Read the docs [here](https://mochi.cards/docs/).

### The card-templating system

Cards (and their _Markdown_) can get rather long, especially if you're creating massive decks with cards that all have the same _format_.

For example, for a deck used to study _words_, **_every_** card might show meta info, like the word's part-of-speech or _Kana_ reading.  
Reproducing the formatting for _every_ card would be tiresome.

To handle this, Mochi allows you to create custom _templates_ for your cards.

A _template_ in Mochi is just _Markdown_ with _'custom fields'_ added in as placeholder for the repeated info (e.g. part-of-speech, _Kana_, hints etc.).  
When you add a card to a deck that uses a template, you just need to fill in the contents of each _field_, and it will automatically slot all the info into your _Markdown_ for you!

Simply create a new template, add all the _custom fields_ you want to use, format the template's _Markdown_ to include these fields, and lastly apply the template to your decks.

Below are some screenshots of my _'Words'_ template in action.

### Other cool features of the app

-   Cloud file syncing for all your decks and content _(paid feature)_
-   _Search_ feature
-   Advanced customizability (including the ability to tweak the SRS intervals)
-   Tags and relational card linking
-   Create shareable public links for your decks
-   Anki ‚Üí Mochi import tool
-   _Markdown_ file export-tool for your decks
    -   currently does not support templated decks

## Why I ditched Anki and Memrise

A few key features mentioned above are missing from Anki and Memrise.

**Anki** offers no cloud storage options if you often switch between devices. You have to manage this yourself somehow. I did this using Google Drive for a while, but just found it clunky.  
Anki's interface is also hard to navigate and a bit Jurassic.

**Memrise** hamstrings you at every corner, and does not cater at all to deck-builders or power-users. It restricts you in some very arbitrary and infuriating ways.

-   There is no _search_ feature... üôÑ
    -   On top of having no search feature, it also paginates your database of items, which makes it _impossible_ to use `Ctrl + F` to find content if you've got a database with thousands of items
-   It's constantly buggy
    -   the memo system never worked, and would constantly delete any memos that I tried to save
    -   The screen didn't scale well when I had a database with many columns (especially when inputting)
-   The app gets in the way while you're trying to input text ‚Äì it tries to autocorrect and auto-predict while you type (and does a poor job of it)

After begrudgingly relying on Memrise for a few years, I was stoked to find Mochi!

## In conclusion...

I've been using Mochi for about half a year, and I am loving it.  
Mochi is a relatively new app, but the developer is putting in tonnes of work into it, ironing out bugs and listening to feedback. It is also available on basically every platform (it also has in-browser app).

These might be deal-breaking to some people, so I'll add a few critiques of the app for completeness:

-   Technical barrier to entry
    -   Users must spend time learning the _Markdown_ syntax and the templating system. Non-technical users might find this painful
-   No community portal for searching for and sharing decks
    -   This is on the development roadmap for the app ‚Äì for now you can create shareable public links to share your decks among friends
-   Two of the big plusses for the app (cloud-sync and text-to-speech) are only available for paid users

For me however, it's really helped bridge a gap that Memrise and Anki just haven't been able to fill, so thanks Mochi! üôè
