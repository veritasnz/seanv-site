Below is a selection of corporate sites I've developed as a freelancer.

For all of these projects:

- I was the sole developer and in charge of all coding and hosting management
- The designs were done by my business partner, and handed to me to be implemented
- Wordpress was used as the CMS, allowing the client to easily be able to add, remove and manipulate the site's text and images
