A wee while after that I moved to Japan for an OE and taught English. I ended up loving it so much that I decided to stay a bit longer. After studying Japanese super hard and becoming proficient, I began my career as a front end developer at a Japanese tech company. With numerous personal and client projects under my belt, I now look forward to what’s next",
