I ended up loving it so much that I decided to stay a bit longer. After attaining business-level Japanese, I began my career as a front end developer there, at a Japanese company. Now I'm back in New Zealand, with numerous personal and client projects under my belt, and looking forward to whatâ€™s next!",
